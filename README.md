# VituBot

## Summary
Used to output site / Clover statuses and analytics to Slack.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
This bot will help enable our engineers as well as Vitu engineers with a quick
overview of the overall status of a site. This is much faster than logging into
PRTG or Meraki to grab these statistics. It also allows engineers to have
access to this information without needing a PRTG / Meraki account.

## Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- fastapi
- meraki
- loguru
- pydantic
- python-dotenv
- requests

## Usage
- Edit the example environment file with relevant Meraki, PRTG, and Slack 
  configuration information.

- Simply run the FastAPI script using Python:
  `fastapi run vitubot.py`

- Commands for the bot and how to use them can be found in this
  [Tettra page](https://app.tettra.co/teams/quokka-one/pages/vitubot).

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.13.1.
